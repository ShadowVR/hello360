# React 360
## Project for learning
### Brett Jay Packard


## About
This is just a simple follow along learning experience to learn React-360. I started a tutorial for React-vr on LinkedIn, and found out while visiting the referenced links for documentation that React-vr has been succeeded by react-360.

While I do look at React code at least a few times a week, I have not yet taken the time to learn React. I do feel that I'm at a disadvantage as I often have to look example code over a couple times to understand unfamiliar methods and designs. But I have experience and knowledge enough to understand it well enough. I will get through this learning project, then revisit it after I've taken the time to learn React.

The source of knowledge for this project can be found at [Facebook's GitHub repo for React 360](https://facebook.github.io/react-360/).
